# MulitResponseAnalyzer
MulitResponseAnalyzer is a very simple app that let's you upload an excel file containing survey data, with the answers of respondents in the rows and with the first row /columnheads with the variables

- select variables/columnes that contain multiresponse answers per participant in multiple columns (like Mention1, Mention2, ...)
- optionally choose break variables (men/women,..)
- optionally choose a filter variable (for example drving licence yes/no)

The app then calculates the % of the mentions in all columns o the multiresponse set for each choosen category
